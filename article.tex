\maketitle

\subsection{Conclusion}
In this article we have discussed intermittent computing, energy harvesting of radio waves and how IoT could potential power much itself by sheer device volume.

Intermittent computing adds a layer of consideration for the programmer and designer of device. But we have also highlighted Ratchet that adds the burden of checkpointing for compute consistency to the compiler.
